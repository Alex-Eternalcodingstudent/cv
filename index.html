    <p>Growing up in a broken family with lower to middle class income, I am determined to dictate the course of my life and not be stuck in this 
        endless cycle of poverty and hard times.
       while this course is uncharted to me and I am unsure how to navigate these rough and sometimes terrifying waters 
       I know that I will find my land of discovery and meaning by the end of it.

       <h3><em>My Journey So Far</em></h3>
        <ul>
            <li> <strong>Education:</strong> 
                I was enrolled in home school after 2nd grade. I was a fast learner at home, often times being 2-3 grades ahead in most subjects.
        school began to feel incredibly boring to me and I started losing any interest in completing a highschool/GED equivalent. 
        that of course I regret till this day as most of society deems this as a scale of ones intelligence and ability to learn,
        This has un-doubtly held me back from new oppertunities. I firmly believe that just means I'm meant for a different path in life.</li> 
            <li> <strong>Course of action:</strong>
                After spending the better part of a decade in an unfulfilling job I decided to buckle down and begin to learn code, 
        as from what ive gathered will keep me on my toes and engaged in the task at hand. 
        it seems to be changing constantly.</li>
            <li> <strong>Resources:</strong> 
                My first class is through udemy by a teacher named Angela Yu.
        she is highly rated and seems like a good starting point before investing a lot of money into going back to school, ive also heard and read that you dont 
        necessarily need any sort of degree to get a job in web development. you simply need to know how to code,
        and will be tested in the interview process to ensure you are at a competent level to be hired.</ul>
